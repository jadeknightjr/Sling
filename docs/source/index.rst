Welcome to Sling's documentation!
==========================================

Sling is an automated framework for managing GitHub repositories around predefined constraints, specifically merging pull requests. It solves the manual burden involved when multiple pull requests need to be merged on GitHub. Unlike services such as GitHub Actions, we allow automation to interact with private configurations and other resources unviewable to the public via a locking system.
